# Weather-Application

This project was created for a class assignment for Rapid Application Development at the University of Central Florida. The goal of the project was to pull an XML feed from a public resource, write it to the database for backup purposes and displayed contents of that feed with PHP and jQuery.
 
This weather application was designed for mobile views and provides a live 24 hour forecast of Orlando, Los Angeles, New York, and Houston which can be displayed in both fahrenheit and celsius. Data is being pulled from a Weather Underground raw XML feed and an Owl Carousel is being used to slide through the current forecast.
